# Project
Meme Generator

# Description
- This application generate meme for user. User will give a text as input and will generate a meme along with image.
- I do this tutorial project along Scrimba and the frame used in this tutorial is Reactjs. 
- The challenges that I faced during this tutorial are some confusing features in callback function and some mistake in define the state object. I also used useEffect for first time in this project.
- I hope I can get more improvement in understanding how to implement this state object, callback function and also conditional tertiary in the future.
